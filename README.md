# Customized-Virtual-File-System
•	Project Name : Customized Virtual FIle System

•	Technology Used: C Programming

•	User Interface Used: Command line Interface (CUI)

•	Platform Required : Windows NT or Linux Distribution

•	Hardware Requirement: Intel 32 bit processor

•	Description of the Project:

o	In this Project, implement data structures used in Operating System for FIle Management System.
o	Provide all implementations of necessary system calls and commands of File subsystem as Open, Close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, RM.
o	While providing the implementations of all above functionality use my own data structures by referring to Algorithms of UNIX operating system.
o	By using this project get the overview of UFS (UNIX File System) on any platform.

•	Data Structure used in the Project:


UAREA  ,  FILE TABLE  ,  IIT (IN CORE INODE TABLE)  , USER FILE DESCRIPTOR TABLE  ,  BOOT BLOCK  ,  SUPER BLOCK  ,    DILB (DATA INODE LIST BLOCK)   ,   DATA BLOCK

•	To run this project use below commands


	Open terminal / command prompt and type below command
	g++ cvf.cpp -o myexe
	then exexute the myexe file, if you're using windows then type myexe or using Linux distros use ./myexe 

•	About
